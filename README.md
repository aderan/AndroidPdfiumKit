This repository combines [AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer)
and [PdfiumAndroid](https://github.com/mshockwave/PdfiumAndroid) for displaying PDFs and acquiring related information.

## Introduction

This project started to extract text from PDFs, as [AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer)
and [PdfiumAndroid](https://github.com/mshockwave/PdfiumAndroid) stopped receiving updates.
Submitting a PR for these projects became impractical, so a new maintenance-focused initiative was launched.
